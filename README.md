Stahpp
Contributors: Sarah Feldmann, Keertana Chandar

Stahpp is a chrome extension that warns users when they visit sites that distract them. When the user visits a distracting site, a warning will pop up asking the user if they actually want to spend their time there. The warning is just a way to make the user conscious of when they go to the sites that they spend time on. We will also send a reminder alert/warning after a default of 10 minutes if the user is still on that site. The user can set times throughout the week for when they want to receive warnings from each site. 

In order to install this app, you will need to clone our github repo. Then visit chrome://extensions and enable develeper mode. After that is enabled, click on 'Load unpacked extension...' and click on your saved version of Stahpp that you just cloned. Make sure it is enabled after it is loaded and then you will be able to use our extension!

To use our app, visit any websites that you would like time reminders on. If you press Stahpp icon in the corner, a popup will show up. You can set a warning for the site and choose the days that you would like the warnings to show up. You can also change the time between reminders if you've been on a site for too long. If at any time you don't want the warnings for a website, you can delete them by pressing on the icon and pressing the 'remove warning' button.
